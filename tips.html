          <h2>The Five Rules of Cooking</h2>
          <p>First of all you must know the 5 Rules of Cooking. They are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Have a Good Knife and Cutting Board.</strong> Having 1 or 2 good knives (specially a chef's
              knife) is essential, along with a stable cutting board. If your cutting board starts slipping, put a wet
              paper towel underneath it. And most importantly, learn and practice knife skills to improve your speed and
              abilities in the kitchen.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare your Space and Ingredients before Hand.</strong> Before you start cooking, always clean
              and clear your space. Gather and prepare all the ingredients beforehand - this is a method used in
              professional kitchens called <i>mise en place</i> to stay organized and efficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook a Lot.</strong> This tip isn't about cooking all the time, but about cooking in volume.
              Make more than needed now to save time later â€” freeze leftovers or repurpose them in other meals. It's
              efficient, convenient, and makes future meal planning easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook with ingredients not only recipes.</strong> Beginner cooks often rely on recipes, but it's
              better to let fresh, quality ingredients guide your cooking. Instead of forcing a recipe with poor
              produce, choose what's fresh and in season, then decide what to make. Practice this weekly with at least
              one fruit or vegetable to build the habit.</li>
            <li><strong>Master YOUR Foods</strong> Choose 5-10 recipes you and your family like, and make them
              regularly. Repeating dishes builds skill, speed, and confidence â€” and also gives you room to adapt them
              with seasonal ingredients or personal touches.</li>
